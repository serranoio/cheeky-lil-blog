This is my soon to be portfolio page, where I have incorporated an entire blog that anyone can create posts on. It incorporates Authentication + all CRUD operations.

To run:


in /server
Im pretty sure you have to install dependencies, so go get all of the imports. Not familiar with the exact command. Im pretty sure go get each individual import works.
```
go run ./main.go serve
```



in /client
install dependencies (npm i)
```
npm run dev
```
Run on localhost:3000, and backend should be ran on the normal http://127.0.0.1:8090

You should be able to check out the portfolio home page and blog!!!🐐🥇🥳🎊🐐🥇🥳🎊🐐🥇🥳🎊🐐🥇🥳🎊🐐🥇🥳🎊

Admin login:

username: user@gmail.com
password: password123

There are still a lot of frontend details that need to be implemented.

Also, how do I even deploy this?!!? I'm genuinely interested.
