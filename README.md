# cheeky-lil-blog
Next-React&lt;->Go-Pocketbase

This is my soon to be portfolio page, where I have incorporated an entire blog that anyone can create posts on. It incorporates Authentication + all CRUD operations.

To run:

Im pretty sure you have to install dependencies, so go get all of the imports. Not familiar with the exact command. Im pretty sure go get each individual import works

in /server
```
go run ./main.go serve
```

install dependencies (npm i)

in /client
```
npm run dev
```
run on localhost:3000, and backend should be ran on

You should be able to check out the portfolio and blog!!!🐐🥇🥳🎊🐐🥇🥳🎊🐐🥇🥳🎊🐐🥇🥳🎊🐐🥇🥳🎊

Admin login:

username: user@gmail.com
password: password123

The frontend uses the JavaScript SDK to talk to the running pocketbase server.

There are still a lot of frontend details that need to be implemented.

Also, how do I even deploy this?!!? I'm genuinely interested.
