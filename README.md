# cheeky-lil-blog
Next-React&lt;->Go-Pocketbase

This is my soon to be portfolio page, where I have incorporated an entire blog that anyone can create posts on. It incorporates Authentication + all CRUD operations.

To run:

```
cd server
(im pretty sure you have to install dependencies, so go get all of the imports. Not familiar with the exact command. Im pretty sure go get each individual import works)
go run ./main.go serve
```

```
cd ..
cd client
install dependencies (npm i)
npm run dev
```

You should be able to check out the blog!!!🐐🥇🥳🎊🐐🥇🥳🎊🐐🥇🥳🎊🐐🥇🥳🎊🐐🥇🥳🎊

Admin login:

username: user@gmail.com
password: password123

The frontend uses the JavaScript SDK to talk to the running pocketbase server.

There are still a lot of frontend details that need to be implemented.

Also, how do I even deploy this?!!? I'm genuinely interested.
